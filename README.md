## Source
"Google Play Store Apps - App data of 1.1 Million applications" dataset collected from [this](https://www.kaggle.com/gauthamp10/google-playstore-apps) kaggle repository and created by [G. Prakash](https://www.kaggle.com/gauthamp10).

## Description & Objectives
Performed exploratory data analysis with descriptive statistics and data visualization, and applied various machine learning techniques. The analysis undertaken was in the context of the CS982 "Big Data" module of Strathclyde University (Glasgow, UK) in the academic year 2019-20.

## Purpose
The results and the diagnostic analysis of the project, using both supervised (classification) and unsupervised methods (clustering), led to insights that can be useful for identifying which attributes are linked with the most popular apps in the Google Play Store.
